# Welcome to my tech blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my experience with the new WSL2 on Window 10 Home Edition.
Microsoft has done a mervellous job in enabling a full blown linux kernel on windows, without the need to
dual boot or use a virtualization. So far so good the experience has been a great one. I have setup a full
blown python and node js development environment on it using vs code as my primary IDE. I also intalled docker desktop
to enable me create and deploy containerized application.

I will be writing more about my experience with WSL2 in the comming days.
